    <p>Welcome to Unavailable Games. By using our website or participating in our games or communities, you agree to the following Terms of Service. These terms are legally binding. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use our services.</p>

    <h2>1. Use of Services</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use our Discord server, in accordance with Discord's Terms of Service. Users under 13 are strictly prohibited from joining the Discord.

    <p>Our Roblox games, including "Unavailable Obby," may be accessible to younger audiences, but we advise parental supervision. See <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410--Roblox-Terms-of-Use" target="_blank">Roblox’s Terms of Use</a> and <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410" target="_blank">Community Standards</a> for age policies and content guidelines.</p>

    <p>You agree not to engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts our services, website, or games. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hacking or exploiting vulnerabilities</li>
      <li>Harassing other players</li>
      <li>Impersonating staff or other users</li>
      <li>Using offensive, discriminatory, or inappropriate language</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Monetization & Affiliates</h2>
    <p>We may use referral or affiliate links (such as Discord invites or Roblox assets) that generate revenue. Participation in these does not come at a cost to you and helps support our project. Monetization through Discord is governed by their <a href="https://discord.com/monetization" target="_blank">Monetization Terms</a>.</p>

    <h2>5. Account Suspension & Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our services at any time, without notice, for violating our rules or applicable laws. Appeals may be made through our support channels, but decisions are final at our discretion.</p>
