    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="legal-content">
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 21, 2025</p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Unavailable Games ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you visit our website and use our Roblox games or Discord server features.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Website Data:</strong> We do not collect personal data directly through our website. However, third-party services like GitHub Pages or your browser may collect anonymized data such as IP address or device info.</li>
        <li><strong>Roblox Game Data:</strong> Within Roblox games, we may collect your username, user ID, and gameplay statistics to provide features such as leaderboards, rewards, or moderation. This is limited to in-game only.</li>
        <li><strong>Discord Data:</strong> If you connect with our Discord bot or server, your Discord user ID, messages, and roles may be stored for bot features, moderation, or role synchronization. This is in line with <a href="https://discord.com/privacy" target="_blank">Discord’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>We only use collected data for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To operate game features (e.g., progress tracking, leaderboard stats).</li>
        <li>To enhance safety and enforce rules (e.g., moderation or bans).</li>
        <li>To sync roles or activity from Discord with Roblox.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties, except as required by law. Some features rely on third-party platforms:</p>
